


YES im on my own now 
i took a vow 
never go back to the blood shed destiny
lead myself to the scheme of epiphany 

left the people behind good or bad 
i walked away without an ounce of feeling sad

with all those fire place ashes 
there was i buried devastated

singing to myself i created a dynasty
there i was ready to be grief-sticken
unfamiliar to the the defeat of my expectancy
shatter on the ground  heartbroken

all my tale were feeble
there i was a damsel
who shall be saved
but i was a warrior
cremated my desire
